# API Bootcamp

In this exercise you will code some simple API requests to a API containg a couple of different data types. The focus here is just to get to know the fetch API built-in in JavaScript

## Exercise 1:

1. Request all the pokemons with fetch from the API.

```
https://majazocom.github.io/Data/pokemons.json
```

2. Render the objects one and one in the console.

3. Render the name of the objects in the DOM instead of the console to make it visible for the user.

## Exercise 2:

1. Request all the dogs with fetch from the API.

```
https://majazocom.github.io/Data/dogs.json
```

2. Render the names of the dogs one and one in the console.

3. Render them out in the DOM instead of the console.

## Exercise 3:

1. Request all the books from the API.

```
https://majazocom.github.io/Data/books.json
```

2. Render all the books to the DOM that have less pages than 500.

## Exercise 4:

1. Request all the visitors to a work-event from the API.

```
https://majazocom.github.io/Data/attendees.json
```

2. Render only the ones that are attending to the DOM.

```
attending: true
```

3. Render only the ones that are attending and have some allergy to the DOM.
